# Giftastic

This is a simple Gif generator that is Game of Thrones themed. It uses the Giphy API in order to generate gifs based on the user's input. The user can type the name of a character, place, event, etc into the text input box and create a new button. Clicking either that button or one of the buttons that are already on the screen as examples will generate 10 gifs from the Giphy API. They all will be still and will only begin moving after they are clicked.

## Prerequisites
